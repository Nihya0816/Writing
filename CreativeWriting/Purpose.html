What is your passion? I love writing!
Why are you passionate about it? I feel like writing can help you when it comes to doing everyday tasks. It's like my own personal outlet and I share my own stories through my writing. Even when doing a school essay, I hate when I can't be creative in my writing because I feel that in order to have a good piece of work it should be unique to the author. I decided recently that I won't go to college for writing because I donâ€™t want to feel like somebody is telling me how to do what I love. My passion for writing should be shown through what I write without having to follow so many rules.
How were you introduced to it? Ever since I was able to pick up a pencil, I've always like to write random words. I was very interested in the spelling of words and how to put them into sentences which came in handy when school came into play.
Who/What served as your inspiration to you in the beginning? My inspiration came from one of my classmates in 8th grade. I remember her talking about writing a book and I figured that I would love to do something like that. Since I loved creative writing and reading I figured that would be a great way to start my own side career of just writing.
Who/What continues to inspire you? My classmates at school and my friends and family inspire me to keep writing. I had a few of them read my book when I was just getting finished and they loved it and wanted to hear more! I still have a few friends who want me to write more but I just haven't gotten around to it.
