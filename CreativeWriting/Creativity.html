    <h1>Creative Writing</h1>
    <p>I love writing! I feel like writing can help you when it comes to doing everyday tasks. It's like my own personal
        outlet and I share my own stories through my writing. Even when I'm doing a school essay, I hate when I can't be
        creative in my writing because I feel that in order to have a good piece of work it should be unique to the
        author. I decided recently that I won't go to college for writing because I don't want to feel like somebody is
        telling me how to do what I love. My passion for writing should be shown through what I write without having to
        follow so many rules.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was able to pick up a pencil, I've always like to write random words. I was very interested in the
        spelling of words and how to put them into sentences which came in handy when school came into play. My
        inspiration came from one of my classmates in 8th grade. I remember her talking about writing a book and I
        figured that I would love to do something like that. Since I loved creative writing and reading I figured that
        would be a great way to start my own side career of just writing.My classmates at school and my friends and
        family inspire me to keep writing. I had a few of them read my book when I was just getting finished and they
        loved it and wanted to hear more! I still have a few friends who want me to write more but I just haven't gotten
        around to it.</p>
